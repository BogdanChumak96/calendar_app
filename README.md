   git clone https://github.com/BogdanChumak96/calendar_app
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file:**
   In the root directory, create a `.env` file and add the required environment variables. Example:

   ```env
   VITE_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Start the project:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   Once the services are running, the application will be available at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### 3. Key Docker Compose Commands

  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

- **Stop the project:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- **Rebuild the containers:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

- **View logs:**

  ```

### 4. Troubleshooting

  Double-check that the environment variables in `.env` are configured correctly.
